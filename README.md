Homework assignment for Week One

This project asked us to improve the existing code (refractoring) to meet certain standards. The page Horiseon, asked us to optimize it for accessibility standards so that its optimized for search engines. 

What I did first was in the main branch, I added an alt tag to each img src to include the accessability standards for the page. I made sure the description of the images included were descriptive and clear to those who are using the site when accessibility features turned on with their personal device. 
Next I made sure the semantic HTML elements were structred in a logical way independent of the styling and positioning. I also changed the heading elements to make sure they fell in sequential order and when clicked on, they bring you to the section of the webpage. 

Finally I pushed all my changes to my repository, added the README, and deployed the site.
